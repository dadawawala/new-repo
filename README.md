Bringing That Horizon
This project is an interactive and responsive website that showcases a music band's merchandising, tour dates, history, requests to perform at special events, and social media accounts. The goal is to allow fans to understand more about the band's history, how it began and where it is now, as well as to look at the merchandise available and when and where they will be touring. The website has an easy-to-use navigation system, visually appealing merchandise galleries with hover animations, and a full history section that commemorates the band's journey. Key features include adaptable layouts for cross-device accessibility, interactive micro-interactions to increase user engagement, and filter choices to make browsing easier. By combining simple design and functionality, the project provides users with a pleasurable and memorable experience that reflects the band's distinct branding.
